After they've paid for their cart, the draft automatically converts into a completed order on the Orders page in Shopify.\n\nA quick note on sales attribution: If you're using Shopify POS on an iOS device, sales from Email cart orders are attributed to the staff member who was logged into Shopify POS via their email when the cart email was sent. Staff signed in with a PIN cannot have sales attributed this way. You can review staff sales in the sales by staff report.\n\nIt's important to remember that you can only send an email for a cart if you intend for the customer to pay for the entire order online. You cannot accept a partial payment in person and then send an Email cart email to collect the remaining balance.\n\nHere\u2019s how to send an Email cart from Shopify POS:\n1. From the Shopify POS checkout, add the customer's chosen products to the cart.\n2. (Optional) Customize the cart as needed.\n3. When you're ready to send, tap the `...` (More actions) button.\n4. Tap **Email to customer**.\n5. Enter the customer's email address.\n6. (Optional) Add a custom message to be included in the email.\n7. Tap **Send**.\n\nThe customer will then receive the Email cart email with a link to pay, and the order will be saved as a draft in your Shopify admin."}], "metadata": {"source_url": "https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/sell-in-person/shopify-pos/order-management/email-cart", "topic": "Manual", "date_scraped": "2025-12-02"}}

With catalogs, you can control the availability of products for your B2B customers and include all products or specific products to a catalog.\n\nIf you want to apply a percentage increase or decrease to all of your product prices, then you can set an overall adjustment. You can also set fixed prices and volume pricing that apply only to specific products or variants. A catalog can contain both an overall percentage and fixed prices. However, fixed prices for products or variants override any overall percentage adjustments that you set.\n\nFor example, your store sells candles at $10 USD each. You create a B2B catalog and enter-20%in the Overall adjustmentfield, which reduces the price of your candles by 20% for companies with access to the catalog. One candle costs slightly more to produce, so you set a fixed price of $9 USD for that product. When a customer with access to the catalog visits your store, they're offered your products at $8 USD, except for the candle that you entered a fixed price for. The fixed priced candle isn't affected by the overall adjustment, and is offered at $9 USD.\n\nAfter youcreate a B2B catalog, you can assign it to a market or acompany location to let B2B customers purchase products at specific prices. Assigning a catalog to markets helps you to manage pricing and product availability for all your B2B customers, or groups of company locations. For example, you can create an All B2Bmarket and assign a catalog to it to create different prices for your B2B and D2C customers. You can also create catalogs for different B2B markets.

This data allows for a more accurate calculation of emissions. However, if the tracking number is unavailable or the shipping carrier isn't supported, then Planet multiplies the estimated emissions by an uncertainty factor of 3. The uncertainty factor ensures that all emissions are accounted for, even in cases where data is inconsistent or missing.\n\nExample: Using the uncertainty factor to calculate your shipping emissions\n\nLet's consider an example to illustrate this process. Suppose you ship a package from Boston to New York. The straight-line distance between the two cities is approximately 305 km, but the shortest road route is around 350 km. If tracking data is available, then Planet uses the exact distance traveled for the calculation.\n\nIn cases where tracking data is unavailable, Planet employs the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between the origin and destination addresses. The Haversine distance refers to the angular distance between two points on the surface of a sphere. It takes in to account the latitude and longitude coordinates of each point, which are represented in radians. This formula allows Planet to estimate the distance accurately, even without tracking data. The resulting emissions are then multiplied by 3 to account for variations in the route, such as distances traveled from post offices and distribution centers, as well as the route taken by the courier to deliver the package to your customer's door.\n\nAdditional considerations on how Planet estimates shipping emissions\n\nPlanet\u2019s models and estimates rely on data input, and in some cases, data might be unavailable. To address this, Planet intentionally overestimates carbon emissions to ensure the purchase of enough carbon removal, even in scenarios where data is missing. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions account for 95% of the climate impact from burning fossil fuels for transportation. The emissions estimated don't account for the release of other greenhouse gases during transportation.\n\nFor sea transportation, the necessary data to accurately calculate emissions isn't generated by orders shipped using this method. In such cases, industry-accepted alternative methods are used to estimate emissions.\n\nPrimary factors used to determine shipping emissions\n\nTo determine shipping emissions, Planet considers three primary factors: weight, distance, and type of transportation.\n\nWeight: The weight of the shipment is the primary value used in the calculation. If the weight isn't available, then Planet uses an average shipment weight as a substitute.Distance: If tracking data is available, then Planet uses the distance recorded in the tracking information. In cases where tracking data is unavailable, Planet employs the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between the origin and destination addresses. The Haversine distance refers to the angular distance between two points on the surface of a sphere. To account for uncertainties in the route, this distance is multiplied by an uncertainty factor of 3.Type of Transportation: Planet determines the mode of transport based on the speed and distance traveled to assign the appropriate carbon-intensity associated with plane versus ground transportation.\n\nWeight: The weight of the shipment is the primary value used in the calculation.

There might be differences in US states that impose additional gross receipts taxes or that allow filing discounts.\n\nDoes automated filing support marketplaces?\n\nShopify Tax automated filing only includes information for orders that are placed on supported channels and marketplaces. Currently these are limited to Shop and Meta, in jurisdictions where this data is required to file compliantly. Otherwise, taxes aren't filed for sales where you aren't the seller of record.\n\nIf you sell through a marketplace, then certain states and localities require that you report those sales in your gross sales totals. These sales aren't included in taxable sales, so they aren't remitted as part of your return. Instead, tax on sales made through these marketplaces is remitted by the marketplace in question. To review orders in your store that are marketplace liable, refer to the Filed by channelcolumn of thetaxes finance report. If the entry for a sale is marked as Filed, then the marketplace has indicated that it files taxes on your behalf.\n\nHow are tax payments made?\n\nDuring theaccount details setup, you specify a payment method for remittance. This account information is submitted to state tax authorities at the time of filing, and is the account that the tax remittance is debted from. Payments are made between the 8th day of the month that your taxes are filed and the state-specific due date.\n\nHow are pick up and retail orders calculated?\n\nAs of July 1, 2024, product tax codes and categories are recorded as they existed at the time that the products were ordered. Destination and origin addresses are matched for these orders. From January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024, if multiple order edits with address changes occurred, then the initial order addresses are used.\n\nHow are sales with refunds reported?\n\nRefunds are included in automated filing calculations when they can be attributed to a specific line item on the invoice.Learn about issuing refunds.\n\nHow do I stop a return from being filed in a given month?\n\nYou can stop a specific return from being filed during a filing period by skipping automated filing. This skips automated filing for the current filing period only, so you can file the return manually. This action can be taken only before the return is scheduled for filing or if there is an issue that can't be resolved.Learn more about skipping automated filing.\n\nHow can I tell if my return was filed?\n\nYour return is marked Filedin your returns dashboard when it's been successfully submitted to the state tax authorities.Learn more about managing automated filing.\n\nWhere can I find a copy of my filed return?\n\nYou can find the filed return report in the documents section of the return detail page.Learn more about reviewing returns.\n\nHow can I amend a return?\n\nAmendments to a return need to be handled manually through state tax authorities.\n\nFor additional details about any of these topics, contact Shopify Support."}], "metadata": {"source_url": "https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/taxes/shopify-tax/automated-filing/faq", "topic": "Manual", "date_scraped": "2025-12-02"}}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the best way to set up my product prices to include taxes and duties for different international markets?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Absolutely! You can configure your Shopify store to display product prices that include taxes and/or duties for customers in specific markets. This helps provide transparency for your international buyers. Here's how to set up both:\n\n**Tax-inclusive pricing**\n\nTax-inclusive pricing allows you to automatically include or exclude taxes in your product prices based on your customer's region for each market you sell to. For example, customers in some countries like the United Kingdom expect prices to include VAT, while in others, such as the United States, taxes are typically added at checkout.\n\nThis applies to regions such as the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, European Union, Mexico, Israel, Norway, Switzerland, Singapore, South Africa, and Japan. For all other countries and regions, taxes are still calculated and displayed at checkout.\n\nBefore activating, it's good to understand how tax-inclusive prices are calculated and the specific countries and regions where this applies.\n\nTo set this up:\n1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Settings** > **Markets**.\n2. Select the market you want to update.\n3. Click **Duties and import taxes**.\n4. In the **Storefront and checkout pricing** section, click the pencil icon. Your current tax and duties settings are displayed, along with a preview of how these settings are communicated to your customers.\n5. In the **Taxes** section, select **Dynamic**.\n6. Click **Done**.\nWhen making your selection, you can preview how prices are displayed to your customers at checkout.\n\n**Duty-inclusive pricing**\n\nWhen duty-inclusive pricing is activated, duties aren't added to the price of your products at checkout. Instead, customers are informed that their total includes duties.\n\nBefore you activate this feature, consider the following:\n*   Duties aren't automatically included in or added to your product prices or checkout; the charge for duties is omitted entirely. You'll need to determine whether you want to pay the cost of duties yourself or adjust your product prices to compensate.\n*   When you activate duty-inclusive pricing, an average cost of duties (based on your store's previous sales or data from comparable stores) is provided as a percentage to help you adjust your prices.\n*   Customers will be informed at checkout that their price includes duties. You might also want to include this information in your store by adding an announcement bar to your header or adding additional product information on product pages.\n\nTo set this up:\n1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Settings** > **Markets**.\n2. Select the market you want to update.\n3. Click **Duties and import taxes**.\n4. In the **Collecting in prices or at checkout** section, click the pencil icon. Your current tax and duties settings are displayed, along with a preview of how these settings are communicated to your customers.\n5. *(Optional)*: Review and record the average cost of duties to adjust your product prices later.\n6. In the **Duties** section, select **Don't add duties**.\n7. Click **Done**.\nWhen making your selection, you can preview how prices are displayed to your customers at checkout.\n\n**Reviewing duties cost**\n\nYou can review how much you spend on duties at any time to ensure your prices are adjusted accordingly:\n1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Analytics** > **Reports**.\n2. Click the **Total sales over time** report.\n3. *(Optional)*: Add the **Market name** column to your report to review duties costs by market.\n4. Divide the amount in the **Duties** column by the amount in the **Net sales** column to determine the percentage of sales associated with duties."}], "metadata": {"source_url": "https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/international/tax-inclusive", "topic": "Manual", "date_scraped": "2025-12-02"}}
